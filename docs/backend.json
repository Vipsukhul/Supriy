    "reasoning": "To support user login and signup for the DebtFlow application, we primarily need a structure to store user information. Given the requirement for authentication, we will utilize Firebase Authentication for handling user credentials. User data will be stored in a dedicated Firestore collection called 'users'. Each document in this collection will represent a user and will be keyed by the user's UID, which is provided by Firebase Authentication. This approach aligns with the principle of path-based ownership, making security rules straightforward. This structure facilitates secure 'list' operations because each user document is directly accessible via their UID, avoiding the need for complex filtering in rules."
